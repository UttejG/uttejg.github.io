    I don't know who you are but I might know what you want.
    If you are looking to hire me I can tell you that I do have a very particular set of skills.
    Skills I have acquired over a six year career. Skills that make me a nightmare for the products you own.
    If you hire me now that'll be the end of it but if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you and I will make you hire me!
